                <h3>Why should i visit ?</h3>
                I am a firm christian believer, and thus, for believers, a visit to Jerusalem is a pilgrimage to one of the most sacred sites in the world. The number of religious tourist attractions here can be baffling for first-time visitors, but luckily most of the top sightseeing landmarks and things to do are secreted within the lanes of the compact Old City district. This ancient landmark is the holiest place in Judaism. References to the area date back to Abraham's near-sacrifice of his son Isaac in Jewish scripture. The site is also the location of the first and second Temples and the spot where many Jewish prophets taught.
